A basic recipe website

By building this website, I'll be practicing foundational HTML skills by writing code. I've just created this repository as a way to both practice using GitHub/Git, and to keep track of my progress as time passes. Once I've completed this project, I will have demonstrated basic HTML skills and proper usage of version control, both of which are important for developing further skills and becoming actual job-marketable skills.

Even though I finished the basic project over two weeks ago, I totally forgot to update the README. Just as a recap, I've written three recipes and made separate web pages for them for this project. There's also an index where the recipes are listed. By completing this project, I've demonstrated basic html foundational skills.
