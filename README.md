A basic recipe website
08/06/2022
By building this website, I'll be practicing foundational HTML skills by writing code. I've just created this repository as a way to both practice using GitHub/Git, and to keep track of my progress as time passes. Once I've completed this project, I will have demonstrated basic HTML skills and proper usage of version control, both of which are important for developing further skills and becoming actual job-marketable skills.
