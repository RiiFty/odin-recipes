    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bought some bananas and forgot to eat them, so now they're all brown and squishy and disgusting? No worries! Just turn them into banana bread. Those types of bananas are the perfect ingredients to use in banana bread. Disclaimer: Don't use rotten bananas, just overripe ones.</p>
    <p>This banana bread recipe is super simple and requires just a few ingredients. Most of them you probably have in your pantry already.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 to 3 medium overripe bananas (they should be at least half brown and squishy</li>
        <li>1/3 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda (not baking powder)</li>
        <li>a pinch of salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar (adjust by 1/4 cups for sweetness)</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (175 degrees C) and prepare the baking pan by buttering it.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, mash the bananas into a paste and stir the melted butter into it.</li>
        <li>Mix in baking soda and salt. Stir in sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour and fold until the mixture thickens.</li>
