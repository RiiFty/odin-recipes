        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Craving some homemade Mexican food but don't have a Mexican friend available to make some for you? Worry not! This recipe is delicious and easy, and it'll make you feel like late-night Taco Bell is just not worth it anymore.</p>
        <p>Now, I don't know if I can call this an authentic Mexican quesadilla recipe, but it sure is a tasty one. Next time, I'll make this for my buddy and see if he approves of it.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 medium onion</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons beef stock/broth or water if you don't have</li>
            <li>12 ounces Mexican cheese blend</li>
            <li>6 flour tortillas</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon flour</li>
            <li>butter or vegetable to grease the pan</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by dicing your onion and bell pepper then set it aside.</li>
            <li>Heat half a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add onion and bell pepper and cook for 3-4 minutes before adding in ground beef. Add ground beef, chili powder, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper and salt. Cook and break up the ground beef into small pieces, stirring occasionally until the beef is fully cooked through (the beef should be brown without any pink). </li>
            <li>Stir in tomato paste and stock/broth/water and add flour immediately after, stirring everything together. Cook for another 1-2 minutes before removing the beef. Drain grease.</li>
            <li>Heat another pan on medium heat. While this is heating up, start making your quesadillas. Take a tortilla and sprinkle cheese on one half. Spoon ground beef onto the same half and then sprinkle more cheese on top. Fold the empty half of the tortilla over so that it becomes a half-circle shape. Repeat with all tortillas.</li>
            <li>Once your quesadillas have been constructed, add butter/vegetable oil onto the pan. Put one or two quesadillas onto the pan, cooking them for 1-2 minutes on one side.</li>
            <li>Carefully flip quesadillas and continue to cook for another 1-2 minutes. Repeat until all quesadillas have been cooked and are a nice golden brown.</li>
            <li>Once finished, cut all quesadillas into halves or quarters, and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
