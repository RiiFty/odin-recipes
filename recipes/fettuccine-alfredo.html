        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A creamy, buttery, delicious recipe that all ages can enjoy. I've always loved pasta dishes and one of my favorite dishes of all time was this baked chicken alfredo that was sold at Costco. Although, it used penne pasta instead of fettuccine, it was a dish that I could eat three servings of each time. Not the healthiest habit, but it was just so good.</p>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, fettuccine alfredo is not an Italian dish. It's actually an American pasta dish. In fact, some Italians hate it when people say that fettuccine alfredo is Italian. It's probably one of the worst things you could say in front of an Italian who loves pasta.</p>
        <p>This recipe is so easy, even a teenager could make it. The ingredients are simple, the preparation is quick, and the process is smooth. It might take a few tries to master the recipe, but just follow these instructions and you'll be making fettuccine alfredo that your friends would beg for the recipe. For this recipe, I use Parmigiano-Reggiano because it has a richer flavor than parmesan, but you can just use parmesan if you don't have or can't find Parmigiano-Reggiano.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500 grams fettuccine pasta</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook fettuccine pasta until al dente according to instructions; drain and set pasta aside.</li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the heavy cream and stir together until combined.</li>
            <li>Add salt, pepper, garlic powder. Stir in the cheese until melted. The sauce should thicken and you can taste-test it. If it's not cheesy enough, add more grated cheese.</li>
            <li>Add pasta to the sauce and mix together so that the pasta is thoroughly coated. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
